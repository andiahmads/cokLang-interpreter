# The CokLang Programming Language & Interpreter
Each interpreter is built to interpret a specific programming language. That's how you "implement" a programming language. 
Without a compiler or interpreter, a programming language is nothing more than an idea or specification.  
We will parse and evaluate our own language called cokLang.

# COK lang specification
```
- C-like syntax
- variable bindings
- integers and booleans
- arithmetic expressions
- built-in functions
- first-class and higher-order functions
- closures
- a string data structure
- an array data structure
- a hash data structure
```

# COK language sightings
``` env
let age = 1;
let name = "Monkey";

let result = 10 * (20 / 2);

```



# quick start
``` console
go test ./lexer
```
